The Whitebox is a collation of vulnerable code found in the real world.  It is your task to write exploit code to leverage these vulnerabilities.

The blog and shop are extremely insecure PHP/MySQL projects.  They where abandoned because these projects contain so many vulnerabilities.   These are great for for security researchers that want to see real world vulnerabilities.

Challenges 1-6 have been released.  These are advanced security systems found in wild,  and they all very insecure.  All of these challenges are in PHP,  some challenges also use MySQL. There are 3 categories in this release;  Cryptography, Filter Bypass and Global Variable Manipulation.
